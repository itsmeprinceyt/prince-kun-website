# Prince‑kun Discord Bot 🤖
Prince-kun is a custom-built Discord bot developed with TypeScript to serve as the all-in-one solution for managing my personal Discord [server](https://discord.gg/HgXNs4p5cx). Designed with both automation and interactivity in mind, the bot handles essential server moderation, user management, and provides a fully integrated backend for ItsMe Prince Shop powered by a MySQL database.

From banning users and sending automated updates to distributing giveaway codes and managing a shop leaderboard, Prince-kun blends practical utility with personal touches. It supports both slash commands and prefix-based commands, and includes rich support for accessing social links, game items, livestream codes, and purchase profiles — making it an essential hub for both server members and clients.

# Development Commands
`dev`
- **Command:** `npm run dev` or `nodemon`

- **Description:** Starts the development server. This command typically watches for changes in your source files (`src/index.ts` in this case) and automatically restarts the server, allowing for a rapid development workflow. It uses tsx watch for this purpose, indicating a TypeScript execution environment.

`build`
- **Command:** `npm run build`

- **Description:** Compiles the TypeScript source code and copies necessary assets using `node dist/copyAssets.js`. After compilation, this script is executed to copy any static assets (like images, CSS, or other non-TypeScript files) from your source directory to the build output directory, ensuring they are included in the final build. 

`start`
- **Command:** `npm run start`

- **Description:** Runs the compiled application. This command is used to start ( `dist/src/index.js` ) after it has been build using `npm run build`.

`sql`
- **Command:** `npm run sql`

- **Description:** Executes only the `dist/src/sql.js` for doing any query related stuff.
